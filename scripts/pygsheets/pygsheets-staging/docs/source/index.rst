Small Example
-------------
First example - Share a numpy array with a friend::

   import pygsheets

   client = pygsheets.authorize()

   # Open the spreadsheet and the first sheet.
   sh = client.open('spreadsheet-title')
   wks = sh.sheet1

   # Update a single cell.
   wks.update_value('A1', "Numbers on Stuff")

   # Update the worksheet with the numpy array values. Beginning at cell 'A2'.
   wks.update_values('A2', my_numpy_array.to_list())

   # Share the sheet with your friend. (read access only)
   sh.share('friend@gmail.com')
   # sharing with write access
   sh.share('friend@gmail.com', role='writer')

Second example - Store some data and change cell formatting::

   # open a worksheet as in the first example.

   header = wks.cell('A1')
   header.value = 'Names'
   header.text_format['bold'] = True # make the header bold
   header.update()

   # The same can be achieved in one line
   wks.cell('B1').set_text_format('bold', True).value = 'heights'

   # set the names
   wks.update_values('A2:A5',[['name1'],['name2'],['name3'],['name4']])

   # set the heights
   heights = wks.range('B2:B5', returnas='range')  # get the range
   heights.name = "heights"  # name the range
   heights.update_values([[50],[60],[67],[66]]) # update the vales
   wks.update_value('B6','=average(heights)') # set get the avg value

Overview
--------
The :ref:`client` is used to create and access spreadsheets. The property `drive` exposes some Google Drive API
functionality and the `sheet` property exposes used Google Sheets API functionality.

A Google Spreadsheet is represented by the :ref:`spreadsheet` class. Each spreadsheet contains one or more :ref:`worksheet`.
The data inside of a worksheet can be accessed as plain values or inside of a :ref:`cell` object. The cell has properties
and attributes to change formatting, formulas and more. To work with several cells at once a :ref:`datarange` can be
used.
